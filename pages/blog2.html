    <article class="container-center showcase-blog">
      <p>
        In this blog we are going to understand var , let and const that
        JavaScript offers also talk about their scope
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/1.jpeg" />
      <p>
        In the above code snippet we are just displaying the age by calling
        function it will correctly log the age
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/2.jpeg" />
      <p>
        Here we are moving the statement outside of the function .Here we're
        getting an error as you can see. The reason for the refrence error is
        because whatever variable you declare inside function actually belong to
        that function because when we execute function a scope is created for
        that function and when the function is done executing it will be remove
        from the stack and there is no memory of it . When we are trying to log
        age it is saying that age is not defined. By this we can conclude that
        any variable declared with var keyword is function scope i.e it scope is
        valid inside the function and not valid outside the function.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/3.png" />
      <p>
        In JavaScript anything that is declared under curly brackets {} is known
        as block. A block is nothing but a multiple set of statements. In the
        above example we can see the name as Hamza is logging even though it is
        outside the block. Therefore we can conclude that var is not block scope
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/4.png"/>
      <p>
        If we try the same code with let and const keyword we will get error as
        both are block scope. Their scope is valid in the block and not outside
        the block
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/5.png" />
      <p>
        For the above code snippet if we try to access the value of i outside of
        for loop it will show 5 but when we will try the same thing with let it
        will show an error as shown below
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/6.png" />

      <img src="../images/blog2/7.png" />
      <p>
        In the above exmaple the value of age is 2 just because it was
        redeclared. That conclude that we can redeclare and reassinged variable
        if we use var
      </p>

      <img src="../images/blog2/8.png"  />
      <p>
        If we try the same thing with let or const it will show an error . Any
        variable that is declared with let keyword cannot be redeclared inside
        its scope . We can declare same variable using let into any other block
        or function
      </p>
      <img src="../images/blog2/9.png" />
      <p>
        In the above example if we reassign or redeclared the variable using
        const keyword it will give an error
      </p>
